                <p>The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. Three types of water footprints are</p>
                <p><span style="color:#00a86b;" class="highlight">Green water footprint</span> is water from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated, transpired or incorporated by plants. It is particularly relevant for agricultural, horticultural and forestry products.</p>
                <p><span style="color:#0c8ac5;" class="highlight">Blue water footprint</span> is water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated, incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another, or returned at a different time. Irrigated agriculture, industry and domestic water use can each have a blue water footprint.</p>
                <p><span style="color:#4b4a4a;" class="highlight">Grey water footprint</span> is the amount of fresh water required to assimilate pollutants to meet specific water quality standards. The grey water footprint considers point-source pollution discharged to a freshwater resource directly through a pipe or indirectly through runoff or leaching from the soil, impervious surfaces, or other diffuse sources.</p>
